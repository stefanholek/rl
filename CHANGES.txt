Changelog
=========

1.9 - 2010-04-02
----------------

- Remove unused defines; we don't support libedit or readline < 5.0.
  [stefan]

- Improve performance of ``get_current_history_length``.
  [stefan]


1.8 - 2010-03-14

  [stefan]


1.6 - 2010-03-07

  removed.
  [stefan]

- Close a memory leak in ``get_current_history_length``.
  [stefan]


1.5.4 - 2010-03-01

------------------

- Re-release with link to the correct issue.
  [stefan]


1.5.2 - 2010-02-26

  missing codecs. This restricts Linux to UTF-8 and Latin-1 locales only.
  Also see rl `issue/5`_.

  [stefan]

- Make the ``display_matches_hook`` work in Python 2.5. Fixes rl `issue/1`_.

.. _`issue/1`: http://github.com/stefanholek/rl/issues#issue/1


1.0 - 2009-11-08
----------------

- No changes since 1.0a8.


1.0a8 - 2009-11-07
------------------

- Close a memory leak in ``word_break_hook``. Three cheers for Xcode's
  ``leaks`` tool.
  [stefan]


1.0a7 - 2009-11-05
------------------

- Rename ``_readline`` module to ``readline`` since it's not private.
  [stefan]

- Remove ``dump`` and ``read_key`` APIs from public interfaces.
  [stefan]


1.0a6 - 2009-10-30
------------------

- Unclutter the ``completer`` interface by removing settings that can
  just as well be made with ``parse_and_bind``.
  [stefan]

- Fix a memory leak in ``username_completion_function`` and
  ``filename_completion_function``.
  [stefan]

- Add a custom epydoc stylesheet to make its reST rendering more pleasant.
  [stefan]


1.0a5 - 2009-10-29
------------------

- Make all ``completion`` properties writable. While not useful in
  production, this allows us to write better tests.
  [stefan]

- Improve API documentation and add a call graph for the completion
  process. This goes a long way in explaining how readline completion
  works.
  [stefan]


1.0a4 - 2009-10-27
------------------

- Implement the ``generator`` factory using an iterator instead of a list.
  [stefan]

- Remove ``find_completion_word`` so people don't get ideas.
  [stefan]

- Don't list distribute as dependency, setuptools will do the
  right thing.
  [stefan]


1.0a3 - 2009-10-22
------------------

- Add ``__slots__`` to interface objects to make them immutable.
  [stefan]

- Support Python 2.5, 2.6, and 3.1 (thanks to distribute).
  [stefan]

- Approach something like test coverage.
  [stefan]


1.0a2 - 2009-10-08
------------------

- Make the ``generator`` factory work for all types of callables.
  [stefan]

- Improve examples.
  [stefan]
