----------------

- No changes since 1.0a8.


1.0a8 - 2009-11-07

  ``leaks`` tool.
  [stefan]


1.0a7 - 2009-11-05
------------------

- Rename ``_readline`` module to ``readline`` since it's not private.

------------------

- Make all ``completion`` properties writable. While not useful in
  production, this allows us to write better tests.
  [stefan]

- Improve API documentation and add a call graph for the completion
  process. This goes a long way in explaining how readline completion
  works.
  [stefan]


1.0a4 - 2009-10-27
------------------

- Implement the ``generator`` factory using an iterator instead of a list.
  [stefan]

- Remove ``find_completion_word`` so people don't get ideas.

- Add ``__slots__`` to interface objects to make them immutable.
  [stefan]

- Support Python 2.5, 2.6, and 3.1 (thanks to distribute).
  [stefan]

- Approach something like test coverage.
  [stefan]


1.0a2 - 2009-10-08
------------------

- Make the ``generator`` factory work for all types of callables.
